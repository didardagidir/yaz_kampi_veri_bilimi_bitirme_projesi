## 📂 Projects Overview

### 1. Data Visualization Project (50_Startups.csv)
**Goal:** Explore relationships between expenses and profits for startups.  
**Tasks:**
- Scatter plot of R&D spend vs profit.
- Scatter plot of administration spend vs profit.
- Average profit by state using a bar chart.
- Comparison of R&D, administration, and marketing spend distributions using a boxplot.  

**Key Findings:**
- R&D spending has a strong positive correlation with profit.
- Administration spend does not show a clear relationship with profit.
- New York and California have higher average profits.
- Marketing spend varies greatly; R&D spend is consistently high.

### 2. Clustering Project (K-Means)
**Goal:** Cluster cases based on different variables using the K-Means algorithm.  
**Tasks:**
- Applied the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- Performed K-Means clustering on scaled features.
- Interpreted cluster characteristics and results.

**Key Findings:**
- Elbow Method suggested an optimal cluster count of **2**.
- Cluster analysis revealed meaningful group separation based on case duration, witnesses, and fees.

### 3. Filtering & Sorting Project (country.csv)
**Goal:** Perform data filtering and sorting tasks on country statistics.  
**Tasks:**
- List countries in descending order of population.
- List countries in ascending order of GDP per capita.
- Select countries with population over 10 million.
- Select top 5 countries by literacy rate.
- Filter countries with GDP per capita greater than 10,000.
- Find top 10 countries by population density.

**Key Findings:**
- China and India have the largest populations.
- Luxembourg and Norway have the highest GDP per capita.
- Population density is highest in small island nations and some European countries.

### 4. NaN Data Cleaning & Analysis
**Goal:** Preprocess and clean dataset for accurate analysis.  
**Tasks:**
- Removed rows with missing values (NaN).
- Conducted analysis and visualizations after cleaning the data.
- Compared filtered and cleaned datasets for improved clarity.

**Key Findings:**
- Cleaning the dataset significantly improved analysis accuracy.
- Removed incomplete data points for reliable results.
